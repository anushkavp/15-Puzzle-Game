# 15-Puzzle-Game
The 15-Puzzle Game is a Python project that challenges players to solve a 4x4 sliding puzzle by rearranging numbered tiles in sequential order. The game is implemented in the "main.py" file, which should be executed to start playing. The puzzle is generated randomly, ensuring solvability, and players can use arrow keys to move the empty space and arrange the tiles from 1 to 15. The project relies on the "pynput" library for keyboard input, providing an interactive gaming experience. Before running the code, users are encouraged to install the "pynput" library using the command "pip install pynput" to enable keyboard interaction during gameplay.
